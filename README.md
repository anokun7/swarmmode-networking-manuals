# A Guide to look at Container Namespaces

When looking online I felt there was good update to information on Docker Swarm Mode / SwarmKit Networking at a really really low level. Sooo here we go:

[1) Containers, Overlay Networks and Network Namespaces](../master/containers_overlaynnetworks.md)

2) Overlay Networks, Multiple hosts and Network Namespaces

[3) SwarmMode DNS Service](../master/swarmmode_ds.md)

[4) SwarmMode Service Discovery and Internal Loadbalancing](../master/swarmode_sd.md)
